# NPM Dependency Policy Compliance Report

## Summary

This project has several dependencies that violate the policy size thresholds and maintenance requirements.

---

## Critical Policy Violations

### 1. @cowprotocol/cow-sdk@5.10.3

- Minified: 546kb | Gzipped: 162kb
- Status: EXCEEDS all thresholds (>200kb for Frameworks/SDKs)
- Last Updated: April 11, 2025 (within 6 months)
- Issue: This is a utility SDK, should be <50kb but is 10x over the limit

### 2. recharts@2.15.4

- Minified: 602kb | Gzipped: 137kb
- Status: EXCEEDS UI library threshold (>150kb)
- Last Updated: June 20, 2025 (within 6 months)
- Recommendation: Consider lighter alternatives like lightweight-charts, visx, or nivo

### 3. ethers@5.7.2

- Minified: 404kb | Gzipped: 133kb
- Status: EXCEEDS Framework/SDK threshold (>200kb)
- Last Updated: October 19, 2022 (>2 years old)
- Critical Issues:
  - Abandoned/outdated (not updated in 2+ years)
  - Project should migrate to viem (already installed at 348kb)
  - Having both ethers AND viem is wasteful

### 4. viem@2.31.7

- Minified: 348kb | Gzipped: 96kb
- Status: EXCEEDS Framework/SDK threshold (>200kb) but acceptable for blockchain SDK
- Last Updated: Recent
- Note: Modern replacement for ethers, tree-shakeable

### 5. @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@2.2.5

- Minified: 263kb | Gzipped: 63kb
- Status: EXCEEDS UI library threshold (>150kb)
- Note: Required for wallet connection UI

### 6. framer-motion@11.18.2

- Minified: 153kb | Gzipped: 49kb
- Status: Just barely over UI library threshold (>150kb)
- Recommendation: Consider motion-one (lighter alternative) or CSS animations

### 7. axios@1.12.2

- Minified: 36kb | Gzipped: 14kb
- Status: Under threshold but could use native fetch
- Recommendation: Modern browsers support fetch API natively, consider removing

## Compliant Dependencies

| Package               | Minified | Gzipped | Category    |
|-----------------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| @clustersxyz/sdk      | 7kb      | 1kb     | Utility     |
| @react-hookz/web      | 20kb     | 6kb     | Utility     |
| @tanstack/react-query | 63kb     | 15kb    | Framework   |
| react                 | 7kb      | 2kb     | Framework   |
| react-router-dom      | <1kb     | <1kb    | Utility     |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. Remove ethers@5.7.2 - Outdated and redundant (use viem instead)
2. Evaluate @cowprotocol/cow-sdk - 546kb is extreme, check if tree-shaking works or find lighter alternative
3. Replace recharts - 602kb for charts is too heavy, consider:
   - lightweight-charts (~50kb)
   - visx (modular, tree-shakeable)
   - native SVG/Canvas implementations

### Consider:

4. Replace axios with fetch - Native API, saves 36kb
5. Evaluate framer-motion - Consider motion-one or CSS animations
6. Review @rainbow-me/rainbowkit - Check if all features are needed
